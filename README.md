# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

Working on behalf of the non-profit foundation AlphabetSoup we created binary classifier to predict whether grant applicants will be successful if funded. We processed th dataset provided by the foundation of 34,000+ organizations that have previously recieved funding and compiled, trained, and tested the neural network model. After the initial testing, we optimized the model for better results.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

-Model's target variables: "IS_SUCCESSFUL" is the variable that measures funding success under the binary "1" and "0".

-Model's feature variables: variables "APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, INCOME_AMT, ASK_AMT" were featured to train the neural network.

-Model's removed variables: variables "EIN" and "NAME" had no potential for pattern training and were dropped.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
