# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

Working on behalf of the non-profit foundation AlphabetSoup we created binary classifier to predict whether grant applicants will be successful if funded. We processed th dataset provided by the foundation of 34,000+ organizations that have previously recieved funding and compiled, trained, and tested the neural network model. After the initial testing, we optimized the model for better results.
